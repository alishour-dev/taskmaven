Task:

Build a single-page web application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. You should use Reactjs as the frontend library for this project. The application should have the following features:

- Task List Display: Display a list of tasks, including their title and status (completed or pending). Use a component to render the task list.
- Add Task: Implement a feature to add a new task to the list. Include input validation to prevent empty task entries.
- Toggle Task Status: Allow users to mark tasks as completed or pending by clicking on them. Implement a visual indication of the task status.
- Filter Tasks: Provide options to filter tasks by status (all, completed, pending). Implement this filter using Angular pipes.
- Delete Task: Allow users to delete a task from the list. Implement a confirmation dialog to confirm task deletion.

Requirements:

- Use Reactjs for building the frontend.
- Create a service to manage the list of tasks and handle CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).
- Generate components, services, and other necessary files.
- Implement responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
- Use forms and validation for the task input.
- Implement routing to navigate between different views (e.g., task list and task details).
- Organize your code following best practices, including proper folder structure and coding conventions.
- Ensure that your application is accessible and follows web accessibility standards.
- Write clear and concise comments in your code to explain complex logic.

Bonus (Highly Recommended):

- Implement user authentication and allow users to save their task lists.
- Add drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks.
- Use Redux for state management.

Submission:

Please provide a link to a GitHub repository containing your project code. Include a README.md file with instructions on how to run the application locally.

Evaluation Criteria:

- Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Code quality and organization.
- React best practices and conventions.
- Functionality and feature implementation.
- User interface design and responsiveness.
- Code comments and documentation.
- Bonus points for additional features.
